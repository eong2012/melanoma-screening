ABOUT THE DATASET USED ON THE EXPERIMENTS:
==========================================

	For the experiments described on this paper, we have employed the 
	images of the "The Interactive Atlas of Dermoscopy" [1].

	The "Atlas" is a multimedia guide (Booklet + CD-ROM) intended for 
	training medical personnel to diagnose skin lesions. 
	
	It has 1000+ clinical cases, each with at least two images of the 
	lesion: close-up clinical image and dermoscopic image. 
	
ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE IMAGES:
=====================================

	The Atlas is a third part development protected by copyright. So, 
	we cannot distribute the images in this repository. 

	If you want to reproduce our experiments on this same dataset, 
	please, acquire the Atlas at [http://dermoscopy.org/] and contact 
	us in order to get the image annotations on readable format for 
	humans and machines.
